Description
-

The aim of the project is to create a convenient way, using CLI, to write plain mathematical functions, save them in a file, read them from a file and solve them by passing arguments(these functions are just like templates).

The database is a file, which is automatically created for you in the user/home folder.

All Commands
-

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `help {command}` | Shows brief important notes about the functional commands of the program |
| `exit` |  Terminates the program and saves all made changes |
| `show {all, <function id>}` | Based on the second argument, the command shows all functions in the database and their *IDs* |
| `add <function>` | Adds a function to the database and the syntax is *f(variables)=(expression)*, where *f* can be any letter, the *variables* are also letters, more about the *expression* below |
| `delete <function id>` | Deletes a function based on an *ID* |
| `solve <function id> <argumnets>`| Based on an *ID*, the corresponding function is solved with the passed arguments and the syntax is *ID f(arguments)*, where *ID* is found by typing command `show all`, f **must** match the function name and *arguments* are just numbers |

And of course the operators
-

Note that each operator **must** be enclosed by *brackets*.
More info is written when needed, as these operators are *trivial*.

| Operators | Usage |
|---|---|
| `var` | *(var)* -> just a variable |
| `!` | *(!(var))* -> multiplies *var* by -1 |
| `+` | *((var)+(var))* |
| `-` | *((var)-(var))* |
| `/` | *((var)/(var))* |
| `*` | *((var)***(var))* |
| `%` | *((var)%(var))* |
| `^` | *((var)^(var))* |

Example functions
-

-  *f(x,y)=((x)/(y))* -> Dividor
-  *g(z)=(!(z))* -> Oppositor
-  *c(a,b,p)=(((a)^(p))+((b)^(p))) -> Pythagoras Formula*
